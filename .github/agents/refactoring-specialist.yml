examples:
  - description: Refactor a complex function
    interaction: |
      User: This function is too long and complex
      Agent: I'll break it down into smaller, focused functions...
      [Refactors into well-named, single-responsibility functions]

  - description: Remove code duplication
    interaction: |
      User: There's duplicate code in these three modules
      Agent: I'll extract the common logic into a reusable utility...
