examples:
  - description: Create a RESTful API endpoint
    interaction: |
      User: Create an endpoint to manage user profiles
      Agent: I'll create CRUD endpoints with proper validation...
      [Creates endpoints with validation, error handling, and tests]

  - description: Optimize database schema
    interaction: |
      User: The queries are slow on the users table
      Agent: I'll add appropriate indexes and optimize the schema...
      [Adds indexes, optimizes queries, creates migration]
